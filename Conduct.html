                            As last season progressed it became clear that our standards are slipping.
                            <br>While we play this game for pleasure we still play competitively and we all try to win
                            games and matches.
                            <br>Nevertheless, we have a set of rules, as there is with any sport, competitive or not.
                            <br>Such rules are put in place not to hinder taking part but so that there is a ‘level
                            playing field’ and so that any one player does not have an advantage over any other.
                            <br>Also if and when we then play in a higher level competition we don’t have to remember
                            the true rules because we are already playing to them.
                            <br>Below I have set out a list of aspects of the game where these principles seem to be
                            slipping as well as some general points covering conduct, care of equipment and so on.
                            <br><br>
                            <ol>
                                <li><u>Players must wear flat soled shoes</u>
                                    <br>This is to protect the surface of the mat and for the same reason it is
                                    unacceptable to wear the same shoes that you’ve worn outside. There are a number of
                                    acceptable alternatives to commercial bowling shoes – please check.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><u>Players must be aware of the foot fault rule.</u>
                                    <br>Check yourself before bowling (and also check other players).</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><u>Players should be aware of the correct position for the fenders and the block.</u>
                                    <br>To make this easier clubs should install Velcro to the underside of the fenders
                                    so that once positioned they stay in place for the whole of the match.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><u>Players should ensure the foot mat is correctly positioned.</u>
                                    <br>Strictly, according to the rules, a foot fault can be called if a player bowls
                                    from an incorrectly positioned foot mat.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><u>Ensure measuring is carried out correctly.</u>
                                    <br> Although we’ve held one or two training sessions on this topic, some measuring
                                    is still done incorrectly. To be fair to all teams and players, captains must check
                                    that players doing the measuring are competent. If more training is required this
                                    can be arranged.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><u>Check the score with the other marker often</u>
                                    <br> suggest every two or three ends.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><u>In case of dispute consult the rule book.</u>
                                    <br>But also make use of experienced players, especially any qualified umpires,
                                    whichever team they represent.</li>
                            </ol>
